Mindfulness Every Day

**Why Everyday?**  
Because mindfulness is normal; it is not something special, limited to 
Buddhists, mystics, academics or psychologists. This is a simple process
that any human being can undertake. Mindfulness is not always an easy 
thing to do, particularly if you have never experienced anything like 
this before or if you are going through intense pain or strong emotions.
But the techniques required to cultivate greater mindfulness are 
incredibly simple and are available to any human being free of charge. 
As time progresses, mindfulness becomes easier and easier to develop and
being in the present moment becomes as much of a habit as our normal 
state of distractedness.
